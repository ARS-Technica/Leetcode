2063. Vowels of All Substrings
Medium
https://leetcode.com/problems/vowels-of-all-substrings/ 

Given a string word, return the sum of the number of vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u')
in every substring of word.

A substring is a contiguous (non-empty) sequence of characters within a string.

Note: Due to the large constraints, the answer may not fit in a signed 32-bit
integer. Please be careful during the calculations.
