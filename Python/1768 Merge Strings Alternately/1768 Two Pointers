1768. Merge Strings Alternately
Easy
https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters 
in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, 
append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

Constraints:

1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100
word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.
