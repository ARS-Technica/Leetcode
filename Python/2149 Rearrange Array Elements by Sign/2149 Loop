2149. Rearrange Array Elements by Sign
Medium
https://leetcode.com/problems/rearrange-array-elements-by-sign/

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of even length consisting of an 
equal number of positive and negative integers.

You should rearrange the elements of nums such that the modified array follows 
the given conditions:

Every consecutive pair of integers have opposite signs.

For all integers with the same sign, the order in which they were present in 
nums is preserved.

The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.

Return the modified array after rearranging the elements to satisfy the 
aforementioned conditions.

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 105
nums.length is even
1 <= |nums[i]| <= 105
nums consists of equal number of positive and negative integers.
