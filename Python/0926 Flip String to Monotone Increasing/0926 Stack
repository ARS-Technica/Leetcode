926. Flip String to Monotone Increasing
Medium
https://leetcode.com/problems/flip-string-to-monotone-increasing/

A binary string is monotone increasing if it consists of some number of 0's
(possibly none), followed by some number of 1's (also possibly none).

You are given a binary string s. You can flip s[i] changing it from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.

Return the minimum number of flips to make s monotone increasing.
