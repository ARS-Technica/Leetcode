541. Reverse String II
Easy
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string-ii/ 

Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k 
characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are 
less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first 
k characters and leave the other as original.
