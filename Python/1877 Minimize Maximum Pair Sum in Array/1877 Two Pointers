1877. Minimize Maximum Pair Sum in Array
Medium
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-maximum-pair-sum-in-array/ 

The pair sum of a pair (a,b) is equal to a + b. The maximum pair sum is the 
largest pair sum in a list of pairs.

For example, if we have pairs (1,5), (2,3), and (4,4), the maximum pair sum 
would be max(1+5, 2+3, 4+4) = max(6, 5, 8) = 8.
Given an array nums of even length n, pair up the elements of nums into n / 2 
pairs such that:

Each element of nums is in exactly one pair, and
The maximum pair sum is minimized.
Return the minimized maximum pair sum after optimally pairing up the elements.

Constraints:

n == nums.length
2 <= n <= 105
n is even.
1 <= nums[i] <= 105
