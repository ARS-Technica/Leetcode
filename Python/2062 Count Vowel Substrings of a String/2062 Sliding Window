2062. Count Vowel Substrings of a String
Easy
https://leetcode.com/problems/count-vowel-substrings-of-a-string/

A substring is a contiguous (non-empty) sequence of characters within a string.

A vowel substring is a substring that only consists of vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u')
and has all five vowels present in it.

Given a string word, return the number of vowel substrings in word.
