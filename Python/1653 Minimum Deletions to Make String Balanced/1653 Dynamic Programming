Medium
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-string-balanced/description/

You are given a string s consisting only of characters 'a' and 'b'.

You can delete any number of characters in s to make s balanced. s is balanced
if there is no pair of indices (i,j) such that i < j and s[i] = 'b' and s[j]= 'a'.

Return the minimum number of deletions needed to make s balanced.
