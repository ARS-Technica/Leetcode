1218. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence of Given Difference
Medium
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-arithmetic-subsequence-of-given-difference/description/

Given an integer array arr and an integer difference, return the length of the
longest subsequence in arr which is an arithmetic sequence such that the difference
between adjacent elements in the subsequence equals difference.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from arr by deleting some or no
elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
