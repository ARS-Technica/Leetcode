821. Shortest Distance to a Character
Easy
https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-to-a-character/ 

Given a string s and a character c that occurs in s, return an array of integers
answer where answer.length == s.length and answer[i] is the distance from index
i to the closest occurrence of character c in s.

The distance between two indices i and j is abs(i - j), where abs is the absolute
value function.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s[i] and c are lowercase English letters.
It is guaranteed that c occurs at least once in s.
