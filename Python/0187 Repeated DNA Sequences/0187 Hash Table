187. Repeated DNA Sequences
Medium
https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences/

The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a DNA sequence.
When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long
sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may
return the answer in any order.
