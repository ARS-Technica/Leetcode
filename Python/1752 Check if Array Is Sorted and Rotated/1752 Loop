1752. Check if Array Is Sorted and Rotated
Easy
https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-array-is-sorted-and-rotated/description/

Given an array nums, return true if the array was originally sorted in
non-decreasing order, then rotated some number of positions (including zero).
Otherwise, return false.

There may be duplicates in the original array.

Note: An array A rotated by x positions results in an array B of the same
length such that A[i] == B[(i+x) % A.length], where % is the modulo operation.
