Created on Thu Apr  7 19:46:02 2022

Given a 0-indexed string word and a character ch, reverse the segment of word 
that starts at index 0 and ends at the index of the first occurrence of ch 
(inclusive). If the character ch does not exist in word, do nothing.

For example, if word = "abcdefd" and ch = "d", then you should reverse the 
segment that starts at 0 and ends at 3 (inclusive). The resulting string will be "dcbaefd".
Return the resulting string.
