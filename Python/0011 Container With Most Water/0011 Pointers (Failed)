https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines 
drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the 
container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.
