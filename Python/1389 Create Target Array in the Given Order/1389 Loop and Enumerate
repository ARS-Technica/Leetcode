1389. Create Target Array in the Given Order
Easy
https://leetcode.com/problems/create-target-array-in-the-given-order/ 

Given two arrays of integers nums and index. Your task is to create target 
array under the following rules:

Initially target array is empty.
From left to right read nums[i] and index[i], insert at index index[i] the 
value nums[i] in target array. Repeat the previous step until there are no 
elements to read in nums and index.  Return the target array.

It is guaranteed that the insertion operations will be valid.
