https://leetcode.com/problems/substrings-of-size-three-with-distinct-characters/ 

A string is good if there are no repeated characters.

Given a string s​​​​​, return the number of good substrings of length three in s​​​​​​.

Note that if there are multiple occurrences of the same substring, every
occurrence should be counted.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
