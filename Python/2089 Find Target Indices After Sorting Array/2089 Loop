You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and a target element target.

A target index is an index i such that nums[i] == target.

Return a list of the target indices of nums after sorting nums in non-decreasing order. 
If there are no target indices, return an empty list. The returned list must be sorted in increasing order.
