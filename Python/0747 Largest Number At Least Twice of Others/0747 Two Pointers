747. Largest Number At Least Twice of Others
Easy
https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number-at-least-twice-of-others/ 

You are given an integer array nums where the largest integer is unique.

Determine whether the largest element in the array is at least twice as much 
as every other number in the array. If it is, return the index of the largest 
element, or return -1 otherwise.

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 50
0 <= nums[i] <= 100
The largest element in nums is unique.
