https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/ 

Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be
separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between
two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the
words. Do not include any extra spaces.
