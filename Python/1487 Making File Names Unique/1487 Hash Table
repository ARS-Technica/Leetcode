1487. Making File Names Unique
Medium
https://leetcode.com/problems/making-file-names-unique/ 

Given an array of strings names of size n. You will create n folders in your
file system such that, at the ith minute, you will create a folder with the name names[i].

Since two files cannot have the same name, if you enter a folder name that was
previously used, the system will have a suffix addition to its name in the form
of (k), where, k is the smallest positive integer such that the obtained name
remains unique.

Return an array of strings of length n where ans[i] is the actual name the
system will assign to the ith folder when you create it.
