28. Implement strStr()
Easy
https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/ 

Implement strStr().

Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence
of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question
to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty 
string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

Constraints:

1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.
