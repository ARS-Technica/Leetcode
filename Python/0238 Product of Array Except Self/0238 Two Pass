238. Product of Array Except Self
Medium
https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal 
to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.
