202. Happy Number
Easy
https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/ 

Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the 
squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops 
endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 231 - 1
