2269. Find the K-Beauty of a Number
Easy
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-k-beauty-of-a-number/

The k-beauty of an integer num is defined as the number of substrings of num
when it is read as a string that meet the following conditions:

It has a length of k.
It is a divisor of num.

Given integers num and k, return the k-beauty of num.

Notes:
Leading zeros are allowed.
0 is not a divisor of any value.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
