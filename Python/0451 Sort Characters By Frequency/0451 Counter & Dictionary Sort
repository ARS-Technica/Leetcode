451. Sort Characters By Frequency
Medium
https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/

Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the
characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in
the string.

Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

"""
'l' and 'o' have the same count, and that's the only sorting key you use.
Your expected output seems to show that you want to use a second key, but you didn't make it explicit. 

Sorts are guaranteed to be stable, which means that if some items have the same
key value, their original order is retained.
 
So you need to specify that the key of the order is not only the number of equal
elements, but the the number of equal elements (with higher importance) and the
element itself (if you want this). So if you want a reverse order for number of
equal elements and (then) an order for the elements value you could just use:

sorted(numbers, key=lambda i:(-numbers.count(i),i))

or equally

sorted(numbers, key=lambda i:(numbers.count(i),-i),reverse=True)

You could want the order to be by number of elements and (then) first appearance
of the element, in this case you can use:

sorted(numbers, key=lambda i:(-numbers.count(i),numbers.index(i)))
