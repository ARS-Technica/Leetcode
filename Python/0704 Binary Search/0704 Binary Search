704. Binary Search
Easy 
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/

Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an 
integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, 
then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
