442. Find All Duplicates in an Array
Medium 
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-duplicates-in-an-array/

Given an integer array nums of length n where all the integers of nums are in 
the range [1, n] and each integer appears once or twice, return an array of all 
the integers that appears twice.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses only constant extra space.
