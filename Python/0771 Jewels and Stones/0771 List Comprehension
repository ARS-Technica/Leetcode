771. Jewels and Stones
Easy
https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/ 

You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, 
and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type
 of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also 
 jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
