Easy
https://leetcode.com/problems/arranging-coins/

You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The 
staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last 
row of the staircase may be incomplete.

Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you 
will build.
