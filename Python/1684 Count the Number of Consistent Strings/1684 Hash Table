1684. Count the Number of Consistent Strings
Easy
https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-consistent-strings/description/

You are given a string allowed consisting of distinct characters and an array
of strings words. A string is consistent if all characters in the string appear
in the string allowed.

Return the number of consistent strings in the array words.
