2022. Convert 1D Array Into 2D Array
Easy
https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-1d-array-into-2d-array/ 

You are given a 0-indexed 1-dimensional (1D) integer array original, and two 
integers, m and n. You are tasked with creating a 2-dimensional (2D) array with 
m rows and n columns using all the elements from original.

The elements from indices 0 to n - 1 (inclusive) of original should form the 
first row of the constructed 2D array, the elements from indices n to 2 * n - 1 
(inclusive) should form the second row of the constructed 2D array, and so on.

Return an m x n 2D array constructed according to the above procedure, or an 
empty 2D array if it is impossible.
