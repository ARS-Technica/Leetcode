1859. Sorting the Sentence
Easy
https://leetcode.com/problems/sorting-the-sentence/description/ 

A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no
leading or trailing spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters.

A sentence can be shuffled by appending the 1-indexed word position to each word
then rearranging the words in the sentence.

For example, the sentence "This is a sentence" can be shuffled as "sentence4 a3
is2 This1" or "is2 sentence4 This1 a3".

Given a shuffled sentence s containing no more than 9 words, reconstruct and
return the original sentence.
