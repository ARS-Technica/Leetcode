2284. Sender With Largest Word Count
Medium
https://leetcode.com/problems/sender-with-largest-word-count/

You have a chat log of n messages. You are given two string arrays messages and
senders where messages[i] is a message sent by senders[i].

A message is list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading
or trailing spaces. The word count of a sender is the total number of words sent
by the sender. Note that a sender may send more than one message.

Return the sender with the largest word count. If there is more than one sender
with the largest word count, return the one with the lexicographically largest name.
