696. Count Binary Substrings
Easy
https://leetcode.com/problems/count-binary-substrings/ 

Give a binary string s, return the number of non-empty substrings that have the
same number of 0's and 1's, and all the 0's and all the 1's in these substrings
are grouped consecutively.

Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
