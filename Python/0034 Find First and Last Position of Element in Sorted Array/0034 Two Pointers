34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
Medium
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/ 

Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the 
starting and ending position of a given target value.

If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
nums is a non-decreasing array.
-109 <= target <= 109

if __name__ == "__main__":
    lc = Solution() 
    print(lc.searchRange())       # 35
    print(lc.searchRange())       # 49
    print(lc.searchRange())       # 35
