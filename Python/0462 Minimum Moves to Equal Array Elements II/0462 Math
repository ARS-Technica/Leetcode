462. Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements II
Medium
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-equal-array-elements-ii/ 

Given an integer array nums of size n, return the minimum number of moves 
required to make all array elements equal.

In one move, you can increment or decrement an element of the array by 1.

Test cases are designed so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.


Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

            average += nums[idx]

Initially thought that this question called for an average.
Actually, it requires the calculation of the median.
