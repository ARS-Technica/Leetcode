392. Is Subsequence
Easy
https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/ 

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string 
by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative 
positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" 
while "aec" is not).

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 100
0 <= t.length <= 104
s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
