2341. Maximum Number of Pairs in Array
Easy
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-pairs-in-array/

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. In one operation, you may do the following:

Choose two integers in nums that are equal.
Remove both integers from nums, forming a pair.
The operation is done on nums as many times as possible.

Return a 0-indexed integer array answer of size 2 where answer[0] is the number
of pairs that are formed and answer[1] is the number of leftover integers in nums
after doing the operation as many times as possible.
