205. Isomorphic Strings
Easy
https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/description/

Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while
preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same
character, but a character may map to itself.
