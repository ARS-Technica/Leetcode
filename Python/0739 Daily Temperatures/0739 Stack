https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/

Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures,
return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to
wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day
for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.
