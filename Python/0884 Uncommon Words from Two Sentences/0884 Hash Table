884. Uncommon Words from Two Sentences
Easy
https://leetcode.com/problems/uncommon-words-from-two-sentences/

A sentence is a string of single-space separated words where each word consists
only of lowercase letters.

A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does
not appear in the other sentence.

Given two sentences s1 and s2, return a list of all the uncommon words. You may
return the answer in any order.
