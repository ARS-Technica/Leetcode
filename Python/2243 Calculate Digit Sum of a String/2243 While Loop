2243. Calculate Digit Sum of a String
Easy
https://leetcode.com/problems/calculate-digit-sum-of-a-string/ 

You are given a string s consisting of digits and an integer k.

A round can be completed if the length of s is greater than k. In one round, do the following:

Divide s into consecutive groups of size k such that the first k characters are
in the first group, the next k characters are in the second group, and so on.
Note that the size of the last group can be smaller than k.
Replace each group of s with a string representing the sum of all its digits.
For example, "346" is replaced with "13" because 3 + 4 + 6 = 13.
Merge consecutive groups together to form a new string. If the length of the
string is greater than k, repeat from step 1.
Return s after all rounds have been completed.
